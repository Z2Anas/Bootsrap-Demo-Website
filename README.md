Overview
This project is a simple demonstration of a frontend website created using Bootstrap, 
showcasing my skills as a new frontend web developer. 
Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework that allows for rapid and responsive web development. 
In this project, I have utilized various Bootstrap components and features to create a visually appealing and functional demo website.

Features
Responsive design: The website is designed to be accessible and visually appealing on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
Bootstrap components: I have incorporated a variety of Bootstrap components such as navigation bar, carousel, cards,
and forms to enhance the user experience and showcase the versatility of Bootstrap.
Custom styling: While Bootstrap provides a solid foundation, I have also added some custom styling to personalize the website and demonstrate my understanding of CSS.
Usage
To view the demo website, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The website is hosted using GitHub Pages, and you can also access it online at Demo Website.

Feel free to explore the different sections of the website and interact with the components to get a sense of the frontend capabilities demonstrated in this project.
